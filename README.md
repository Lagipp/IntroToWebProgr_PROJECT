# IntroToWebProgr_PROJECT

This is the final project for the course CT30A2910 Introduction to Web Programming.
Letting the students choose from 3 options, I decided to make an HTML5 game using Phaser.js.

<br />

## Installation:

Open your preferred IDE, clone the repository using ``` git clone \link_to_repository\ ``` and navigate to the root folder.

Install the required dependencies with the command 'npm install'.
```
$ npm install
```

Start the application by running 'npm run start'.
```
$ npm run start
```

After waiting for a few seconds, the program can be accessed from any browser at 'localhost:9000'.

Type ```localhost:9000``` into your preferred browser.

Shutdown the game by pressing ```Ctrl + C``` / ```^C``` (or alternatives) in the IDE.
